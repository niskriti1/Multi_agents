# Multi_agents

A multi-agent system (MAS) is a computerized system composed of multiple intelligent agents. These agents interact with each other to solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of individual agents. Agents in a MAS can be humans, robots, software programs, or any other entity capable of autonomous action.
